## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

* Toggle extensions between active and inactive states
* Filter active and inactive extensions
* Remove extensions from the list
* Select their color theme
* View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
* See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* Stylus (CSS Preprocessor)
* Flexbox
* CSS Grid
* Mobile-first workflow
* JavaScript (Vanilla)
* Data fetched from `data.json`

### What I learned

During this project, I learned the importance of **dynamic rendering** using JavaScript, especially when managing a list of items with multiple states (active/inactive). I also gained a deeper understanding of **fetching data from a JSON file** and dynamically rendering content based on user actions like toggling and filtering.

Hereâ€™s an example of how the data is rendered dynamically:

```js
const extCard = document.createElement("div");
extCard.classList.add("extension");
extCard.innerHTML = `
  <div class="info">
    <img src="${ext.logo}" alt="${ext.name} logo">
    <div>
      <h3>${ext.name}</h3>
      <p>${ext.description}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="btns-info">
    <button class="remove-btn">Remove</button>
    <input type="checkbox" ${ext.isActive ? "checked" : ""}>
  </div>
`;
```

### Continued development

For future improvements, I plan to:

* Implement user authentication to allow users to save their list of extensions across sessions.
* Explore **local storage** or **server-side databases** to save the state of the extensions.
* Enhance the **UI** with more interactive elements like hover effects and animations.
